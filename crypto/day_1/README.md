# Cryptography Day 1

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Cryptography is widely used since we want to make sure information we are sending is sent to the desired party with no chance of being intercepted and seen by a third party.</li>
    <li>I grew interested in Crypto when I heard it was math heavy.</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h2>Beginning Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Has anyone taken a formal/informal course in Crypto or self-studied the topic? Those who have try to help those around you to make sure everyone is following.</li>
    <li>Ask audience members to explain what they think cryptography is.</li>
    <li></li>

<h2>Classical Cryptography</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I've prepared brief slides to introduce the topics with accompanying exercises to work through.</li>
    <li>Easy to solve, with known decryption procedures</li>
    <li>Don't rely on computationally intensive tasks to decrypt, such as RSA</li>
    <li>During CTFs I usually just plug these into various websites instead of writing something to solve them.</li>
    <li>Showcase of websites</li>
</ul>
